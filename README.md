# dtwa_squeezing
Discrete truncated Wigner approximation code (dtwa) 

Evaluates magnetization, correlations and squeezing for Heisenberg models within dtwa. Code is parallelized to run on multiple cores. 

- simulator_vacancy_template.py simulator code for Monte Carlo with vacancy disorder. 


- simulator_poisson_disorder_template.py simulator code for Monte Carlo equation where the disorder is Poisson.

- simulator_bilayer.py simulator for the bilayer system
