# dtwa_squeezing
Discrete truncated Wigner approximation code (dtwa) 

Evaluates magnetization, correlations and squeezing for Heisenberg models within dtwa. Code is parallelized to run on multiple cores. 

-simulator_vacancy_template_NxNretain.py retains all individual NxN matrices throughout and saves Sx,Sy,Sz on all sites
-simulator_vacancy_template.py at not stage (except integration) do we work with NxN matrices.
